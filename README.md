RailMeal Express üöÇüç±
Fresh Food, Delivered to Your Train Seat!
RailMeal Express is a single-page HTML website template designed for a railway food delivery service. This project serves as a front-end proof of concept, showcasing key features of a modern food ordering platform tailored for train passengers.

The website provides a seamless user experience, from Browse a menu to placing an order and selecting a payment method, all within one dynamic page.

Features
Homepage: A welcoming section with brand highlights and a call to action.

Interactive Menu: A categorized menu with food items, prices, and images.

Order System: A simple cart and a form for customers to provide essential delivery details like train number, seat, and station.

Payment Gateway (Placeholder): A section outlining different payment options, including UPI, cards, and net banking.

Contact/Support: Easy-to-find contact information via phone, WhatsApp, and email.

Responsive Design: The layout is built to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and content.

CSS3: For styling, layout, and a vibrant, railway-inspired color theme.

Font Awesome: For icons used in the contact section and elsewhere.

Google Fonts (Poppins): For a clean and modern typography.

How to Run
This is a front-end only project, so no server is required.

Clone the repository or download the index.html file.

Open the index.html file in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

That's it! The website will load and be fully interactive.

Customization
You can easily customize this template to fit your specific needs:

Brand Name & Logo: Change the text "RailMeal Express üöÇüç±" in the <h1> and <title> tags.

Colors: Modify the CSS variables (--primary-red, --secondary-yellow, etc.) at the top of the <style> block to change the color theme.

Menu Items: Replace the images, titles, descriptions, and prices in the #menu section.

Images: Update the image src URLs with your own food photos. I recommend using high-quality images to make your menu more appealing.

Contact Info: Update the phone number, WhatsApp link, and email address in the #contact section.

Disclaimer
This is a static, client-side template. The order form and payment gateway are for demonstration purposes only and will not process real orders or payments. To make this a fully functional e-commerce website, you would need to implement a backend server to handle:

Processing form submissions.

Managing the shopping cart and order data.

Integrating with a real payment gateway API (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay).

Handling user authentication and order tracking.
